Insider risk occurs when sensitive corporate data—intellectual property, digital assets, trade secrets, crown jewels—move to untrusted places like personal devices, email, or cloud destinations. Such data movement presents considerable competitive, financial, privacy, and compliance risk. The scope of the problem is significant. According to Aberdeen Research, one in three reported data breaches involve an insider. The cost of a data breach from an insider can account for up to 20% of a company’s annual revenue. Insider risk is not a new problem, but it has become increasingly urgent due to drivers like digital transformation, hybrid-remote work, and the “great enemies resignation,” not to mention a noticeable uptick in the use of contractors and recent layoffs.
